## What is Kubarr?

Kubarr is a dashboard that makes it simple to deploy and manage your media automation apps — Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Lidarr, and more — on a Kubernetes cluster. Think of it like [Swizzin](https://swizzin.ltd/) or [Saltbox](https://saltbox.dev/), but built for Kubernetes.

No YAML wrangling. No Helm headaches. Just pick the apps you want, click deploy, and you're done.

## Why Kubarr?

- **One-click deploys** — Pick apps from the catalog and deploy them with sensible defaults
- **Everything in one place** — Monitor all your apps, check logs, and manage configs from a single dashboard
- **Real-time status** — See at a glance what's running, what's healthy, and what needs attention
- **Easy configuration** — Edit settings, environment variables, and secrets through the UI instead of digging through files
- **Notifications** — Get alerts via email or webhook when something goes wrong
- **Secure by default** — User accounts, roles, and audit logging out of the box

## Get Started

```bash
helm install kubarr oci://ghcr.io/bmartensnl/charts/kubarr -n kubarr --create-namespace
```

That's it. Once the pods are ready, open the dashboard and log in with the credentials from the install output.

For more details, see the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md).
