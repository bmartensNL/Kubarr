# Kubarr Architecture

*Documentation in progress*

This document will cover Kubarr's system architecture and design decisions.

## Current Overview

Kubarr consists of three main components:

- **Backend** (Rust/Axum) - API server with Kubernetes client integration
- **Frontend** (React/TypeScript) - Modern SPA with real-time updates
- **Database** (PostgreSQL/SQLite) - Application state and configuration storage

See the project README for a basic architecture diagram.

## Coming Soon

- Detailed component architecture
- Data flow diagrams
- Security architecture
- Scalability considerations
- Design decisions and trade-offs
